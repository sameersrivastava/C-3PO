# C-3PO (GroupMe Bot)

## Set-Up
This bot is hosted on heroku and runs on NodeJS. I started this from the existing [GroupMe NodeJS Callback Bot Tutorial](https://github.com/groupme/bot-tutorial-nodejs).

I had some cloning issues, so I followed [this StackOverflow Answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18751063/trying-to-heroku-gitclone-after-heroku-fork-yields-an-empty-repository) to fix that.



## What does this Bot do?
